# 📡 Task 5: Wireshark Packet Capture & Protocol Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify key protocols, and understand how different applications use the internet.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Wireshark (Windows 11)
- Google Chrome
- Command Prompt (for ping)

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. Opened Wireshark and selected active Wi-Fi interface for live capture.
2. Opened 4 Chrome tabs:
   - ChatGPT
   - Flipkart
   - OLX
   - LinkedIn
3. In Command Prompt, ran:
4. Captured TCP, DNS, ICMP, TLS traffic.
5. Applied filters (`tcp`, `icmp`, `dns`) to isolate specific protocols.
6. Saved captured packets in `.pcapng` format.

## 📁 Files Included
- `day5_capture.pcapng` – Main packet capture
- `report.md` – Protocol analysis report
- Screenshots (optional)

## ✅ Outcome
- Learned how to monitor real-time traffic
- Understood browser activity and ping requests at packet level
- Practiced filtering and saving useful traffic

## 📡 Protocols Captured

### ✅ 1. TCP
- Seen in all HTTP/HTTPS browser communication
- Port 80 and 443 in use

### ✅ 2. DNS
- Captured when domain names resolved (flipkart.com, olx.in, etc.)
- UDP traffic on port 53

### ✅ 3. ICMP
- Generated by `ping google.com`
- Used to measure latency

### ✅ 4. TLS
- Seen in HTTPS encrypted sessions (LinkedIn, ChatGPT)

## 💡 Key Learnings
- How web activity and terminal commands generate network packets
- Filters make protocol-specific analysis easy
- `.pcapng` files are powerful for later forensic analysis
